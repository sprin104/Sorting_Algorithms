# Sorting Algorithms
This project allow you to visualize sorting algorithms as
                they run to get a better understanding of how they actually work. Sorting algorithms are used to put
                elements in arrays in acceding or descending order. Traditionally, sorting algorithms are not very 
visual,
                but here you can watch each step the algorithms go through as they sort bars of different lengths.
